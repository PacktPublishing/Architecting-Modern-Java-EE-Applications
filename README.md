# Architecting Modern Java EE Applications
This is the code repository for [Architecting Modern Java EE Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/architecting-modern-java-ee-applications?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788393850), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Java EE 8 brings with it a load of features, mainly targeting newer architectures such as microservices, modernized security APIs, and cloud deployments. This book will teach you to design and develop modern, business-oriented applications using Java EE 8. It shows how to structure systems and applications, and how design patterns and Domain Driven Design aspects are realized in the age of Java EE 8. You will learn about the concepts and principles behind Java EE applications, and how to effect communication, persistence, technical and cross-cutting concerns, and asynchronous behavior.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

These examples match the code snippets shown in the book.They are aimed to give the readers an idea of the material.The examples can be viewed in an IDE and all build project examples can be compiled and packaged successfully.
However, not all examples are meant for deployment to an application server.This is due to the variations in the examples.The same reasoning caused comments put into JavaDoc and `package-info.java` files that explain the structure of these examples.These comments would not be part of an enterprise project.

Chapters 3 and 4 does not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
@PreDestroy
public void closeClient() {
    client.close();
}
```

To execute and perform the code examples given in the book, you will require the following tools configured in your system:
* NetBeans, IntelliJ or Eclipse IDE
* GlassFish Server
* Apache Maven
* Docker
* Jenkins
* Gradle
